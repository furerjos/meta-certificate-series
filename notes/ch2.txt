History of JavaScript
- Built in only 10 days in 1995 by Brendan Eich, tasked with building a simple scripting
language to be used in version 2 of Netscape browser. 
- Initially called LiveScript, but changed to JavaScript due to Java's popularity (no relation)
* Netscape made a deal with ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) to draft the 
specification of JS, in 1997 first edition of ECMAScript specification was published.
- Issued as ECMA-262 standard (updated 12 times, first was in 1997).
- JS exists as an implementation known as a JavaScript engine. You write JS code to "talk to" a JS
engine like a browser. 
- JS interacts with other parts of the browser using Browser APIs. 
-2009 changed JS for allowing the JS Engine to be used as a stand-alone entity, able to use JS outside of a browser, as a separate program on cmd line, or as a server-side environment. Created by Ryan Dahl
