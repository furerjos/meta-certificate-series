Chapter 2 â€“ Programming with JavaScript

## Introduction to JavaScript

- JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for web development.
- You can style console output in the browser using `%c` in `console.log`. For example:
  ```js
  console.log("%cHello, World", "color: blue; font-size: 40px");
  ```
  The `%c` placeholder applies the provided CSS styles to the text.

## Data Types

JavaScript has **7 primitive data types**:
- `string`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `symbol`
- `bigint`

> Note: `BigInt` and `Symbol` were added in later versions of JavaScript.

## Brief History of JavaScript

- Created in just 10 days in 1995 by Brendan Eich for Netscape Navigator 2.
- Originally named **LiveScript**, but renamed to **JavaScript** to capitalize on Java's popularity (despite being unrelated).
- In 1997, Netscape worked with ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) to standardize the language, resulting in the first edition of the **ECMAScript** specification (ECMA-262).
- The ECMAScript standard has been updated many times since 1997.
- JavaScript code runs on a **JavaScript engine** (e.g., V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox).
- JavaScript interacts with browsers via **Browser APIs** (e.g., DOM, Fetch API).
- In 2009, **Node.js** (created by Ryan Dahl) enabled JavaScript to run outside the browser, allowing server-side and command-line applications.

## Example: `switch` Statement Syntax
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to execute if expression === value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // code to execute if expression === value2
    break;
  case value3:
    // code to execute if expression === value3
    break;
  default:
    // code to execute if no cases match
    break;
}
